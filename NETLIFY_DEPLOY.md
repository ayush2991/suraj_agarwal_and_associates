# 🚀 Netlify Deployment - Complete Guide

## How It Works

Your application now has **two modes**:

### 🏠 Local Development
- Uses `chat.config.js` with your API key
- Calls Gemini API directly from browser
- For testing and development

### 🌍 Production (Netlify)
- Uses **Netlify Functions** (serverless backend)
- API key stored securely in environment variables
- Never exposed to the browser
- Automatically detected and used

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Make sure everything is committed
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for Netlify deployment with secure API handling"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Netlify

1. Go to: **https://app.netlify.com/**
2. Click **"Add new site"** → **"Import from Git"**
3. Choose **GitHub** and authorize
4. Select your repository: `suraj_agarwal_and_associates`
5. Build settings (should auto-detect):
   - **Build command:** (leave empty)
   - **Publish directory:** `.` (root)
   - **Functions directory:** `netlify/functions` (auto-detected)
6. Click **"Deploy site"**

### Step 3: Add Environment Variable (CRITICAL!)

1. Go to **Site settings** → **Environment variables**
2. Click **"Add a variable"**
3. Add:
   - **Key:** `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - **Value:** `AIzaxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
   - **Scopes:** Leave default (all)
4. Click **"Create variable"**

### Step 4: Trigger Redeploy

1. Go to **Deploys** tab
2. Click **"Trigger deploy"** → **"Deploy site"**
3. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment

### Step 5: Test Your Site

1. Click on your site URL (e.g., `https://random-name.netlify.app`)
2. Click the chat button
3. Try asking: "What services do you provide?"
4. ✅ If it works, you're done!

## 🔍 How the Security Works

### Local Development:
```
Browser → chat.js → Direct API Call → Gemini
          (uses chat.config.js)
```

### Production (Netlify):
```
Browser → chat.js → Netlify Function → Gemini
                    (API key in env var)
```

**Your API key never appears in the browser on production!**

---

## ✅ Verify Everything is Working

### Check #1: Functions Deployed
- Go to **Functions** tab in Netlify
- You should see: `chat`
- Status should be: **Active**

### Check #2: Environment Variable Set
- Go to **Site settings** → **Environment variables**
- Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` is listed

### Check #3: Test the Chat
- Open your deployed site
- Open browser console (F12)
- Click chat button and send a message
- Check for errors in console

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "API key not configured" error

**Solution:**
1. Check environment variable is set correctly
2. Variable name must be exactly: `GEMINI_API_KEY`
3. Redeploy after adding environment variable

### Issue: "Failed to get response" error

**Check:**
- Browser console for detailed errors
- Netlify Functions logs (Functions tab → Select chat → View logs)
- Verify API key is valid at https://makersuite.google.com/

### Issue: Chat works locally but not on Netlify

**Causes:**
1. Environment variable not set
2. Functions not deployed
3. API key invalid or rate limited

**Fix:**
```bash
# Redeploy with clear cache
netlify deploy --prod --clear-cache
```

### Issue: 404 on /.netlify/functions/chat

**Fix:**
1. Verify `netlify.toml` has:
   ```toml
   functions = "netlify/functions"
   ```
2. Check `netlify/functions/chat.js` exists
3. Redeploy

## 🎨 Customize Your Domain

### Change Netlify Subdomain:
1. **Site settings** → **Domain management**
2. **Options** → **Edit site name**
3. Change to: `suraj-agarwal-ca` 
4. Your site: `https://suraj-agarwal-ca.netlify.app`

### Add Custom Domain:
1. Buy domain (e.g., surajagarwalca.com)
2. **Domain management** → **Add domain**
3. Follow DNS configuration steps
4. Netlify provides free SSL automatically!

---

## 📊 Monitor Your Deployment

### Netlify Dashboard:
- **Analytics:** View visitor stats
- **Functions:** Monitor API usage and errors
- **Deploy logs:** See build history

### Gemini API Usage:
- Go to: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
- Check usage under your API key
- Free tier: 15 requests/minute

---

## 🔒 Additional Security (Optional)

### Restrict API Key to Your Domain:

1. Go to: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Click your API key → **Edit**
3. **Application restrictions:**
   - Select: **HTTP referrers (web sites)**
   - Add: `https://your-site.netlify.app/*`
   - Add: `https://*.netlify.app/*` (for preview deploys)
4. **Save**

Now your API key only works on your domain!

---

## 🚀 Continuous Deployment

Every time you push to GitHub:
1. Netlify automatically rebuilds
2. New version goes live in 1-2 minutes
3. No manual deployment needed!

```bash
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update content"
git push origin main
# Site auto-updates!
```

- Gemini API: Free tier (15 RPM)
- SSL Certificate: Free
- Domain: Only if you buy custom domain (~$10-15/year)

**Estimated costs for 1000 visitors/month:** $0
